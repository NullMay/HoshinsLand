# HoshinsLand

A service for gathering translators from around the whole world. We're planning to make it a donation based website with two main systems:

Freelance system: people choose the translator of their choice and request them the translation of the work they would like to see.

Contest system: A certain sum of money (prize) is collected for the translation of some work, translators offer their translations and people pick the best translation. The prize goes to the winner/winners of the contest.
